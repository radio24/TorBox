# DESCRIPTION
# This is the TorBox Wireless Manager - an easy, userfriendly way to
# connect the TorBox to a wireless network. It is a replacement of wicd,
# which is based on Python 2 and seemes to be abadone by the developers.
#
# SYNTAX
# sudo torbox_wireless_manager.py -i <interface> [-a|--autoconnect]
#
# -i <interface>: Interface to connect - mandatory!
# -a|--autoconnect: Don't show an interactive user menu, just try to automatically connect to an already know network
