WARNING
Your selection will open SSH port 22 to the Internet, allowing remote access to your TorBox from anywhere.

This poses significant security risks:
- Your TorBox becomes vulnerable to brute-force attacks
- Malicious actors can attempt to gain unauthorized access

Only enable this if you understand the security implications and have proper safeguards in place (strong passwords, key-based auth, etc.).

How do you want to enable SSH access from the Internet (ESC -> go back)?
