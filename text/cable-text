This menu entry supposes that TorBox is connected to the Internet through
the onboard Ethernet interface (eth0). It is also the case if TorBox is
hosted on a cloud.

The next step is to set up TorBox so that your client devices have access
through TorBox's wireless network (wlan0), through an USB Ethernet
adapter (eth1), and/or via an installed VPN server (tun1). In case of an
USB Ethernet adapter: please plug in the adapter and connect the ethernet
cable with your client device NOW.

If we have to restart TorBox's wireless network, please reconnect your
client without closing the ssh session. Usually, the configuration
continuous -- if not, then please repeat the process.
