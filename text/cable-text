This menu entry supposes that TorBox is connected to the Internet through
the onboard Ethernet interface (eth0).

The next step is to set up TorBox so that your client devices have access
through TorBox's wireless network (wlan0) and/or through an USB Ethernet
adapter (eth1). In the second case, please plug in the adapter and
connect the ethernet cable with your client device NOW.

If we have to restart TorBox's wireless network, please reconnect your
client without closing the ssh session. Usually, the configuration
continuous -- if not, then please repeat the process.

Would you like to CONTINUE?
