This menu entry supposes that TorBox is connected to the Internet through the onboard Ethernet interface (eth0). It is also the case if TorBox is hosted on a cloud.

The next step is to set up TorBox so that your client devices have access through TorBox's wireless network if enabled in the Configuration sub-menu (wlan0), through an USB Ethernet adapter (eth1), and/or via an installed VPN server (tun1). This configuration also supports TorBox mini (usb0). In case of an USB Ethernet adapter: please plug in the adapter and connect the ethernet cable with your client device NOW.

If we have to restart TorBox's wireless network, please reconnect your client without closing the ssh session. Usually, the configuration continuous -- if not, then please repeat the process.
