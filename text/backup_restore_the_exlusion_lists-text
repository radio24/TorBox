HOW CAN I BACKUP/RESTORE THE EXCLUSION LISTS?
The exclusion lists are backed up and restored by the backup and restore options in the Update and Maintenance sub-menu. However, you can also backup/restore the exclusion list manually.

BACKUP MANUALLY
- Access TorBox's home directory by using an SFTP client (it uses the same
  login and password as your SSH client).
- Go to ~/torbox/run/ and download the following files, if existing:
  clearnet-list.own vpn-list.own
- Alternatively, you can copy these files by connecting an USB stick to
  your TorBox. You can mount the USB stick, most probably by
	"sudo mount /dev/sda /mnt".

RESTORE MANUALLY
- Stop the exclusion of domains from tor protection in the Danger Zone
  sub-menu, if not already done.
- Access TorBox's home directory by using an SFTP client (it uses the same
  login and password as your SSH client).
- Go to ~/torbox/run/ and upload the previously saved files:
  clearnet-list.own vpn-list.own
- Start the exclusion of domains from tor protection in the Danger Zone
  sub-menu.
