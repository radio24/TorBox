This menu entry enables TorBox's WebSSH, which allows you to connect to TorBox using a web browser. You can access it via 192.168.42.1 on a WiFi client, 192.168.43.1 on a cable client, and/or 192.168.44.1 when connected via VPN or with a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W as a RNDIS/Ethernet Gadget.

However, this comes with a small but manageable risk. Because web browsers don't easily support self-signed certificates, WebSSH is not encrypted. This fact shouldn't create problems because the client access should be under your control. Additionally, WebSSH is not reachable from the Internet even if (the ordinary) SSH access from the Internet is enabled.

Keep using an ordinary SSH client if you seek maximum security.
