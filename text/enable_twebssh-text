This menu entry enables TorBox's Web SSH, which means you can connect
TorBox with a web browser, using 192.168.42.1 on a wifi client,
192.168.43.1 on a cable client and/or 192.168.44.1 when connected via VPN
or with a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W as a RNDIS/Ethernet Gadget.

However, this comes with a small but manageable risk. Because web browsers
don't easily support self-signed certificates, webssh is not encrypted.
This fact shouldn't create problems because TorBox's AP, its wlan and/or
the connection cable should be controlled by you.

Keep using an ssh client if you seek maximum security.
