You are about to enable a passwordless TorBox's WLAN, which makes sense if you want to share TorBox with guests and others who may need unrestricted, easy access.

However, convenience comes with substantial risks. The transmission of data between the client and TorBox's WLAN will be unencrypted, allowing anyone nearby to intercept usernames, passwords, emails, and financial information if the used protocols or software does not encrypt them. Because solely using Tor doesn't guarantee anonymity, but is also dependent on the user's behaviour. In case of potential illegal content access or cybercriminal activities, you, as an operator, could face legal consequences since all activity traces back to your connection. It could be convenient for bad-behaved guests, but not for you.

Enabling passwordless TorBox's WLAN offers ease of use for guestsâ€”but creates serious security, privacy, and legal risks. Only activate such a network if you fully understand and accept these consequences, and take all possible steps to mitigate abuse and exposure.

At the end of the configuration we are going to reboot TorBox.
