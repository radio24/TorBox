Currently, no bridges are configured. Bridges are necessary for TorBox to bypass Tor blocking in a country. With the help of this dialog-based configuration assistant, bridges can easily be added. When adding more than 5 bridges, it is recommended to use the advanced configuration editor (menu entry 13).

HOW TO OBTAIN SNOWFLAKE BRIDGES?
In contrast to OBFS4 bridges, in general, the Torproject doesn't provide additional Snowflake bridges. However, there are Snowflake bridges for specific countries, like China, Russia, Iran and Turkmenistan. Besides TorBox's internal bridges, TorBox can automatically try to fetch more Snowflake bridges.
