Would you like to reset your TorBox configuration files?

IMPORTANT
- THIS WILL DELETE ALL YOUR CONFIGURATION!! ALSO THE DEFAULT PASSWORDS
  WILL BE SET: CHANGE-IT
- We recommend to make first a backup with menu entry 6, and also to
  update the TorBox's menu entry 5. This will also provide you with the
  newest configuration files, stored in /home/torbox/torbox/etc.
- After the reset, we recommend to re-run the First Start-up Dialogue
  with menu entry 12, and to change the essential passwords with entry 1
  and 2 in the Configuration sub-menu.
