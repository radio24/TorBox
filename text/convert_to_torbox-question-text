With a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, we have to configure some additional settings.

The driver for the Broadcom BCM43436 WiFi chip on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
cause a kernel panic when WPA3-SAE (0x2000) and roaming (0x80000) are
enabled.

Impact: System instability, WLAN disconnects, potential data loss during
active sessions.

Fix: turning off WPA3-SAE and roaming.

Will the converted system be used in a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W?
