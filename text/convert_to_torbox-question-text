With a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, we have to configure some additional settings.

Broadcom BCM43436 WiFi chip on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W exhibits kernel
NULL pointer dereference in brcmf_p2p_send_action_frame+0x234 when P2P and
WPA3-SAE are enabled in firmware.

Root cause chain: hostapd initializes P2P → driver attempts P2P frame
transmission → firmware bug in P2P handler → NULL pointer dereference →
kernel OOPS (Tainted: CRAP).

Impact: System instability, WLAN disconnects, potential data loss during
active sessions

Fix: adding p2p_disabled=1 to hostapd

Will the converted system be used in a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W?
