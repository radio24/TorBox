This menu entry supposes that TorBox should be connected to the Internet
through an USB WiFi adapter (wlan1). Often, only 2.5 GHz band USB WiFi
adapters  work out of the box, but we installed additional drivers to
support some common 5 GHz band USB WiFi adapters (see also here:
https://www.torbox.ch/?p=1747). Also, another menu entry allows you to
connect to the Internet through the onboard wireless chip,  which also
supports the 5 GHz band.

The next step is to set up TorBox so that your client devices have access
through TorBox's wireless network (wlan0) and/or through Ethernet (eth0).
In the second case, please plug in the ethernet cable with your client
device NOW.

If we have to restart TorBox's wireless network, please reconnect your
client without closing the ssh session. Usually, the configuration
continuous -- if not, then please repeat the process.
