Disabling SSH access from the Internet means you can only use SSH from a client device connected to the TorBox. If you are using TorBox on a Cloud, then you can only log into TorBox with SSH when the client is connected to the server via OpenVPN. Be careful not to lock yourself out of the box!

Would you like to disable SSH access from the Internet (this is the default)?
