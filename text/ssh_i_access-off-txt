 This menu entry will close SSH port 22 to external Internet access, significantly improving your TorBox security. After disabling, you can only access SSH from:
 - Local network devices connected to TorBox (wlan0, eth1, tun1 interfaces)
 - Remote connections through OpenVPN tunnel (if configured)

 WARNING
 If you're running TorBox on a cloud, make sure you have OpenVPN properly configured and tested BEFORE disabling SSH Internet access!
 Without OpenVPN, you might be locked out of your TorBox on a cloud.

 Would you like to disable SSH access from the Internet (this is the default)?
