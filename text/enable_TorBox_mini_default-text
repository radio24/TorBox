The default TorBox mini configuration assumes that a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W (or a similar device) is connected to the USB port of your client. The RNDIS/Ethernet Gadget mode ensures that the client can access the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W via the usb0 interface. The wlan0 interface will be used to access the Internet.

Important
Deactivating other connection options in TorBox mini's Main Menu will also automatically disable TorBox's WLAN.

Do you want to deactivate other connection options in TorBox mini's Main Menu (this is the default for TorBox mini)?
