It seems that after finishing the configuration, your client will only be connected to the TorBox through an Ethernet cable (eth0). However, currently, you may be connected to the onboard WiFi chip. If this is the case and you find yourself disconnected from the TorBox, then just restart the TorBox and try to connect via the Ethernet cable.

To make it work, we will turn off a failsafe preventing you from being locked out of the TorBox.

IMPORTANT
- You should only continue if the client is connected through an Ethernet
  cable with the TorBox to avoid a lock-out situation.

Would you like to CONTINUE?
