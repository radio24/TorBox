Isn't this a TorBox mini default installation?

To enable TorBox's WLAN, first, you have to enable other connection options in TorBox mini's Main Menu by using entry 8 in the Danger Zone sub-menu.

As a heads-up: Enabling TorBox's WLAN on a TorBox mini installation will disconnect the TorBox mini from the Internet. Therefore, the possibility to select a new Internet source in the Main Menu after the change has to be enabled.
