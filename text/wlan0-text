This menu entry supposes that TorBox should be connected to the Internet through the onboard wireless chip supporting the 2.5 and 5 GHz bands (wlan0). The process is complicated because, by default, TorBox is configured to use the onboard wireless chip as an Access Point for clients. During the network configuration, please be patient. However, if TorBox remains stuck, reboot it, and the new network configuration should be applied. You may choose this menu entry again after the reboot to connect to the Internet. There is also a fair risk of being locked out :-/ .

IMPORTANT
Not all USB WiFi adapters work correctly as an Access Point - the simpler
the adapter, the higher the chance for success. Especially, USB WiFi
adapters supporting the 5 GHz band usually don't work correctly as an AP,
and we recommend using main menu entry 6 instead or connecting the
client with an Ethernet cable (eth0).

The next step is to set up TorBox so that your client devices can access TorBox's wireless network (wlan1) and/or Ethernet (eth0). In the second case, please plug in the ethernet cable with your client device NOW.
