SNOWFLAKE circumvents sophisticated censorship. In contrast to the OBFS4 bridges (see menu entries above), SNOWFLAKE is based on another technique, which should also work for users in China, Iran, Russia or Turkmenistan (see also our discussion: https://github.com/radio24/TorBox/discussions/179).

IMPORTANT
- This menu entry activates SNOWFLAKE bridges of TorBox to bypass
  Tor blocking in a country. It helps to circumvent censorship; however,
  it doesn't help if a firewall blocks the network traffic.
- Currently, Snowflake supports only one bridge line. Only the first one
  will be used if you select several bridge lines.
- If SNOWFLAKE bridges don't help, try OBFS4 or MEEK-AZURE.
- BRIDGE RELAY MODE will automatically be deactivated; the configuration
  will be kept for later re-activation.
