This menu entry supposes that TorBox is connected with the internet through a VPN connection using the interface tun0. There are two possibilities of how TorBox handles VPN connections:

1. The VPN connection is already established, and the interface tun0 is
   configured.

2. The VPN connection is not established yet, but one ore more *.ovpn
   - files are in the ~/openvpn directory so that TorBox can execute
   OpenVPN with that file.

IMPORTANT
- We do NOT recommend using a VPN. If Tor entry guards cannot be reached
  for censorship reasons, we recommend using OBFS4 bridges as a priority
  (main menu entry 11). We consider a VPN connection as a last resort.
- Nevertheless, we consider the additional risk of this "Tor over VPN"
  situation to be proportionate - see here: https://bit.ly/31lUhLQ

The next step is to set up TorBox so that your client devices have access through TorBox's wireless network (wlan0), through Ethernet (eth0), and/or via an installed VPN server (tun1). This configuration also supports TorBox mini (usb0). In case of a cable connection: please, plug in the ethernet cable with your client device NOW.

If we have to restart TorBox's wireless network, please reconnect your client without closing the ssh session. Usually, the configuration continuous -- if not, then please repeat the process.

To completely disconnect from a VPN, please, use the countermeasure sub-menu entry 17. Using in the main menu entries 5-9 will only change the route of Torâ€™s network traffic to the Internet, but local network traffic from the command prompt will still be routed through the VPN.
