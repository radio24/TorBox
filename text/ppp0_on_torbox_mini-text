This menu entry supposes that TorBox mini should be connected to the Internet through a cellular link (ppp0, for example, the Sixfab Shields/HATs for
cellular connections). These interfaces have to be configured BEFOREHAND.

If available, the following interfaces are also available for client devices: if enabled in the Configuration sub-menu (wlan0), through Ethernet (eth0), and/or via an installed VPN server (tun1).

Important: USB dongle creating usbX interfaces are not supported under TorBox mini. For special requirements, please contact the TorBox development team --> https://www.torbox.ch
