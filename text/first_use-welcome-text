Congratulation, you got TorBox running!

If you are running this "First Start-up Dialogue" for the first time, TorBox hasn't yet connected to the Tor network. However, it will do so after the following dialogue boxes, which will ask you the following:
- if you want to use the standard hostname (TorBox053) or set your own or a
  randomized hostname;
- if you want to use a (default) firewall circumvention method;
- from where the Internet is coming;
- if you want to activate the TorBox automatic counter actions;
- if you want to use OBFS4 or SNOWFLAKE bridges;
- and if you want to install additional network drivers.

Leaving now, for security reasons, tor will stay BLOCKED from communicating with the Internet. However, you can rerun the script using the Update and Maintenance sub-menu if needed.

If you need additional help, please visit https://www.torbox.ch or our GitHub page (https://github.com/radio24/TorBox).

Do you want to continue with the following dialogue boxes (the default is YES)?
