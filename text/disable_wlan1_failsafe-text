During the start-up of TorBox, by default, there is a failsafe in place to put TorBox's AP back on wlan0 if it was used on wlan1. It will prevent the lock-out of the TorBox user.

However, if the TorBox user will permanently has the TorBox AP on wlan1, which is usually a USB wlan adapter, he can DISABLE that failsafe by using this menu entry.

By using this menu entry again, the failsafe can also be ENABLED again, which is the default.

Would you like to ENABLE or DISABLE the wlan1 failsafe?
