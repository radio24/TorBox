This menu entry disables temporary (until next reboot) or permanently (not recommended) TorBox's WLAN. It makes only sense and is only possible if your client is connected via Ethernet cable.

ATTENTION: If you permanently disable TorBox's WLAN and start-up TorBox without an Ethernet cable, you probably will lock out yourself from accessing TorBox.

How do you want to disable TorBox's WLAN?
Choose with SPACE and then press ENTER (ESC -> go back)
