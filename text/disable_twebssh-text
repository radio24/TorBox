This menu entry disables TorBox's WebSSH, which means that you can not connect TorBox with a web browser anymore after pressing enter. You will be disconnected if you are using the web browser right now.

IMPORTANT
Disabling WebSSH will not change the connectivity to the SSH service itself. For disabling the SSH service or SSH access from the Internet and/or from Clients, please select the appropriate option in the Danger Zone sub-menu.
