This menu entry supposes that TorBox is connected with the internet through tethering or an USB ethernet adapter (eth1). These interfaces have to be configured BEFOREHAND. For example, with an iPhone: Unlock your iPhone, but let the personal hotspot disabled for the time being and connect it with the TorBox. Choose to trust your iPhone (necessary!). Enable personal hotspot on your iPhone (USB only) and continue with the configuration.

IMPORTANT
Usually, the tethering device (Smartphone) is charging its battery while connected with the USB port. This can lead to a unstable system. A better solution may be to create a personal hotspot with your smartphone instead of using tethering.

The next step is to set up TorBox so that your client devices have access through TorBox's wireless network (wlan0), through Ethernet (eth0), and/or via an installed VPN server (tun1). This configuration also supports TorBox mini (usb0). In case of a cable connection: please, plug in the ethernet cable with your client device NOW.

If we have to restart TorBox's wireless network, please reconnect your client without closing the ssh session. Usually, the configuration continuous -- if not, then please repeat the process.
