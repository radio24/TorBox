Would you really like to update the firmware of your Raspberry Pi 4 or 5?

IMPORTANT
- Use a reliable power supply.
- Don't remove power from your TorBox during the update.
- If something goes wrong, your EEPROM could be left corrupted, and
  the RPI4/5 wont boot again. In such a case, download and use the
	Raspberry Pi Imager to create a Recovery SD Card. For more
	information, see here: https://t.ly/5DGqT
- You have to reboot the system at the end.
