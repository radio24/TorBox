# DESCRIPTION
# This file tries to fix all network-related problems, like wrong assigned IP
# addresses, issues with dhclient, hostapd, and others. It also restarts
# TorBox's wireless network (AP, hostapd) if we use a WLAN adapter as an AP,
# checks if the daemon is working, and, if not, resets the configuration with
# the last working version and restarts the daemon again. If nothing works,
# the configuration is set that way that after a restart, TorBox's wireless
# network can be found on wlan0.
#
# SYNTAX
# nohup ./hostapd_fallback_komplex_part_1 <interface 1> <interface 2>
#
# <interface 1>: Is the interface with the AP: wlan0 or wlan1.
# <interface 2>: Is the interface with the connected cable client: eth0 or eth1
#
# IMPORTANT
# There is no failsave configuration in this procedure, because it interfered
# with the rest. The failsave is part of the rc.local script. It will check for
# wlan1 entries in the configuration fails and substitutet them with wlan0.
#
#
# EXCEPTION: don't run on TorBox mini (will replace /etc/network/interfaces)
#            --> asuming that we don't have clients on the wifi

# ATTENTION: Under Raspberry Pi OS we can grep dhclient, but under Debian that's not possible because dclient is started on
