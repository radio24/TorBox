# DESCRIPTION
# This file restarts hostapd, check if the daemon is working and if not resets
# the configuration with the last working version and restarts the daemon again.
# Before hostapd is changed, you have to add the following line in the code:
# sudo cp ${HOSTAPD} ${HOSTAPD_SAV}
# This creates the backup file, which is needed by HOSTAPD_SAV.
#
# SYNTAX
# nohup ./hostapd_fallback
#
#
##### SET VARIABLES ######

HOSTAPD="/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf"
HOSTAPD_SAV="/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf.tbx"
